# GithubSocialGraph
Creation of a Social Graph derived from user data accessed using the GitHub API - Part of my Software Engineering coursework


# GithubAccess

The relevant commit for this portion of the assignment can be found at commit c14579cad3e4813e067cd265a604e6ba66c81ea6,
and the folder that contains the basic code also includes a screenshot for proof of it working.

According to the course website, the goal to be achieved for this was to "Interrogate the GitHub API to retrieve and display data
regarding the logged in developer". In order to satisfy the requirements of this assignment, I wrote a basic program that
accesses the names of all repos that the logged in user has, and displays the name of each repo and their most recent commit.
